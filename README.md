# Muecken

Ruby library to parse and analyze financial data. This library is work in
progress and not really usable yet. Feel free to look around but don't expect
too much ;)

Muecken (German for "mosquito", an informal word for money) is supposed to
provide an easy way of parsing, analyzing and categorizing financial data to
give you an overview of where money comes from and, most probably more
important, where it goes.

The main design goal for this library is simplicity, so I'm using the Ruby
standard library as much as possible.

## Categorization

It is important to make the categorization as straight forward as possible so
that it is actually usable and doesn't end up in too much manual work.

I have some ideas about a learning algorithm, as soon as I'll start working on
it I'll elaborate here...
