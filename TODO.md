# Muecken - TODO

This is a basic TODO list for my personal use. As soon as Muecken reaches a
stable state bugs and features are to be tracked via GitHub issues...

- inline documentation
- string cleaner for descriptions
- matcher for amount ranges (e.g. 0€ - 50€)
- generic support for ORMs like active record
- performance tests / benchmarks
