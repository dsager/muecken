# Muecken - TODO

This is a basic TODO list for my personal use. As soon as Muecken reaches a
stable state bugs and features are to be tracked via GitHub issues...

- "engine" implementing basic work flows
- simple YAML persistence
- different category matching behaviours (all rules must match, at least one, ...)
- mandatory category groups: an entry must belong to at least one category of  this group
- string cleaner for descriptions
- additional matcher classes
  - amount ranges (e.g. 0€ - 50€)
  - specific parts of the description, like reference numbers
- generic support for ORMs like active record
- performance tests / benchmarks
